Several questions remain unresolved as to how to link redox couple solubility to solvent structure and dynamics at high redox couple concentrations. D3TaLES is motivated to extend the upper limits of redox couple solubility through the concerted design of redox-active molecules and solvation environment and exploring how nano-scale interactions and dynamics of heterogeneous domains in solvents will directly determine the macroscopic LES properties.
