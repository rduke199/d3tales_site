 was conceived from the idea that truly novel advances in the discovery and design of liquid-based energy storage (LES) materials will require synergistic efforts that both create new domain knowledge in materials science and capitalize on the mass collection, creation, analysis, and modeling of curated data via tools such as machine learning (ML). Our mission, to exploit data science to fill knowledge gaps and accelerate our ability to discover and develop LES materials, is enabled by the construction of an interdisciplinary network of collaborators who have expertise in materials design, characterization, and deployment, autonomous experimentation, and data analytics and ML. In total, our synergistic research, infrastructure, and workforce development activities will situate Kentucky and Iowa as leaders in addressing the critical and growing need for energy storage capacity.
