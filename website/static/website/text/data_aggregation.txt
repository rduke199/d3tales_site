An overarching problem in the materials literature is that there is often simply not enough curated data for advanced data analytics and machine-learning approaches to be useful. High-throughput computations provide one avenue to create large-scale datasets, though the data is often only as good as the assumptions that go into the particular method. Further, from the experimental standpoint, given a limited amount of data acquisition and lack of reporting standards, questions arise concerning confidence in the validity of reported data, and so-called ‘dark’ data from failed experiments are severely underreported despite their value in training machine-learning models. Here, D3TaLES will leverage recent developments in natural language processing, high-throughput computation, and autonomous experimentation to create and curate an open-access database of mineable data for LES materials.
